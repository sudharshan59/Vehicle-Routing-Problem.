# **🚚 Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) – Optimization with Python**

**This project explores the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a cornerstone of logistics optimization.** Using Python, it models how to efficiently route multiple vehicles to serve a set of customers while minimizing total travel cost, distance, or time.

## **🎯 Objective**

- **Optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicles**
- **Minimize total distance or cost**
- **Respect constraints like vehicle capacity and customer demand**

## **🧠 Problem Overview**

The **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** is a generalization of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. It involves:
- A depot (starting point)
- Multiple vehicles
- A set of customer locations
- Constraints (e.g., capacity, time windows)

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**

- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Plotly (for route visualization)**
- *(Optional: OR-Tools, PuLP, NetworkX for advanced solvers)*
